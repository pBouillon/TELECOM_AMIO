This project has been realized by [Pierre Bouillon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pierre-bouillon/) and [Antoine Jacque](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoine-jacque/).

## Overview

`IoTLab sensors` is a small Android application, built to detect abnormal behavior in the usage of some sensors
retrieved from the IoTLab API. Moreover, it also provides a minimalist view of the various sensors, their current
state and measures.

An extensive documentation on its usage and how it is built is available [in the wiki](https://github.com/pBouillon/TELECOM_AMIO/wiki).
